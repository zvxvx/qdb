```js
<ImDoneWithPointe> where can I learn about C structures to deeper levels
<perr_> what do you mean?
<perr_> their feelings?
<perr_> there's not much to them
<ImDoneWithPointe> like, where can I learn about C structures with so much knowledge that I can call myself the StructureMaster
<ImDoneWithPointe> The X_StructureMaster_X
<ImDoneWithPointe> and also I want to become a 3starProgrammer
<perr_> "modern c" is good
<ImDoneWithPointe> I want to be able to use 53 dereferences for accessing my variables
<ImDoneWithPointe> okay thank you
<ImDoneWithPointe> want me to recite my lore?
<ImDoneWithPointe> I used to be a pointer lvl 0 rookie
<ImDoneWithPointe> everyione made fun of me at elementary school
<ImDoneWithPointe> then I practiced to be the best pointerMaster in the universe
<ImDoneWithPointe> it was a journey through the deepest caves of the internet
<ImDoneWithPointe> had to deal with so many monsters and trolls
<ImDoneWithPointe> but now.... I am the pointerMasterX
<ImDoneWithPointe> but now I retire from pointing
<ImDoneWithPointe> now I am craving for my next honorary: the structMaster
<mefistofeles> wtf
