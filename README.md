# QDB

#### an irc quote database inspired by the glory days of bash.org

### Quotes

- Each submission will be put in an .md file in src/content/quotes
- This generates a static path to the quote, as well as added to the growing paginated list of quotes.
- Manual work should only be making a new .md file.

### News

- .md files w/ frontmatter stored in src/content/news
- This will probably be used sparingly.

### Contributing

Open a pr with a new branch titled appropriately to what you're contributing.
